Control MPRIS-compatible media players over the network using a web interface.

Visit [layout_demo.html](static/layout_demo.html) to see a static demo of the interface layout.

## Features

- Play/pause, next, previous
- Fast forward and rewind (10 seconds per click)
- Draggable progress bar
- Change loop and shuffle modes on supported players (X icon when off)
- Remove player (trash icon)
- Polling pauses when the web interface is not visible to save resources, also controllable via a toggle button

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

[playerctl](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl), available in most package managers, must also be installed.

## Usage

```

```
The web interface is available at the computer's local IP address (and [localhost](http://localhost:58468)), port 58468.
